## Projects
### Project 1: Facial Keypoint Detection
Use image processing techniques and deep learning techniques to detect faces in an image and find facial keypoints, such as the position of the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face.This project tests one’s knowledge of image processing and feature extraction techniques that allow one to programmatically represent different facial features. Use one’s knowledge of deep learning techniques to program a convolutional neural network to recognize facial keypoints. Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on any face and are used in many applications, from facial tracking to emotion recognition.<br>

### Project 2: Image Captioning
Combine CNN and RNN knowledge to build a deep learning model that produces captions given an input image. Create a complex deep learning model with two components: a CNN that transforms an input image into a set of features and an RNN that turns those features into rich, descriptive language. Implement these
cutting-edge deep learning architectures.<br>

### Project 3: Landmark Detection & Tracking
Use feature detection and keypoint descriptors to build a map of the environment with SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping). Implement a robust method for tracking an object over time using elements of probability, motion models, and linear algebra. This project tests one’s knowledge of localization techniques that are widely used in autonomous vehicle navigation.<br>
